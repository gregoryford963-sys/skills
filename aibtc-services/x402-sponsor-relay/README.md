# x402-sponsor-relay

Gasless transaction sponsorship service for AI agents on the Stacks blockchain. Accepts pre-signed sponsored transactions, covers the gas fee, verifies payment parameters, and broadcasts to the network.

- **Production:** https://x402-relay.aibtc.com (Stacks mainnet)
- **Staging:** https://x402-relay.aibtc.dev (Stacks testnet)
- **Docs:** https://x402-relay.aibtc.com/docs (Swagger UI)
- **Stack:** Cloudflare Workers, Hono.js, Chanfana, Durable Objects (SQLite)

## Purpose

Enables AI agents to perform Stacks transactions without holding STX for gas fees. Agents build sponsored transactions (fee = 0) and submit them to this relay, which sponsors the fee and broadcasts to the network. Also implements the x402 v2 facilitator API for compatibility with standard x402 client libraries.

## Authentication

### Relay Endpoint (POST /relay)

No authentication required. Rate limited to 10 requests per minute per sender address.

Optional SIP-018 structured data authentication for enhanced security:
- Domain-bound signatures specific to x402-sponsor-relay
- Replay protection via nonce (unix timestamp ms)
- Time-bound authorization via expiry timestamp

### Sponsor Endpoint (POST /sponsor)

Requires an API key in the `Authorization: Bearer x402_sk_...` header.

**Obtaining a free API key:**

```bash
# Via Bitcoin signature (BIP-137)
POST /keys/provision
{
  "btcAddress": "bc1q...",
  "signature": "<BIP-137 signature of 'Bitcoin will be the currency of AIs'>",
  "message": "Bitcoin will be the currency of AIs"
}
```

Returns `{ apiKey: "x402_sk_..." }` valid for 30 days.

Note: During agent registration at aibtc.com, the platform automatically provisions a sponsor API key for the agent.

### API Key Tiers

| Tier | Requests/min | Requests/day | Daily Fee Cap |
|------|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| free | 10 | 100 | 100 STX |
| standard | 60 | 10,000 | 1,000 STX |
| unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited | No cap |

## Relay Flow

Agents must build transactions with `sponsored: true` and `fee: 0n`:

1. Build a sponsored Stacks transaction (fee = 0)
2. Serialize to hex
3. POST to `/relay` with settlement parameters
4. Relay validates, sponsors fee, and broadcasts
5. Returns `txid`, `settlement` status, `sponsoredTx` hex, and `receiptId`
6. Use `GET /verify/:receiptId` to check confirmation

**Settlement states:**
- `confirmed` — Transaction confirmed on-chain within 60 seconds
- `pending` — Broadcast succeeded but confirmation timed out (safe, poll `/verify/:receiptId`)
- `failed` — Transaction aborted or dropped on-chain (not retryable)

**Idempotency:** Submitting the same sponsored tx hex within 5 minutes returns the cached result. Safe to retry on network failure.

## Request/Response Examples

### POST /relay

```json
{
  "transaction": "<hex-encoded-sponsored-tx>",
  "settle": {
    "expectedRecipient": "SP...",
    "minAmount": "1000000",
    "tokenType": "STX",
    "expectedSender": "SP..."
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "txid": "0x...",
  "explorerUrl": "https://explorer.hiro.so/txid/0x...",
  "settlement": {
    "success": true,
    "status": "confirmed",
    "sender": "SP...",
    "recipient": "SP...",
    "amount": "1000000",
    "blockHeight": 12345
  },
  "sponsoredTx": "0x00000001...",
  "receiptId": "550e8400-..."
}
```

**202 Transaction Held** (sender nonce out of order — queued for later broadcast):

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "code": "TRANSACTION_HELD",
  "error": "Transaction held — sender nonce is out of order",
  "queue": {
    "position": 1,
    "senderNonce": 42,
    "sponsorNonce": 5,
    "walletIndex": 0,
    "heldAt": "2026-03-29T10:00:00.000Z",
    "expiresAt": "2026-03-29T11:00:00.000Z"
  },
  "retryable": true
}
```

Use `GET /queue/:senderAddress` to inspect held transactions. Once the gap is filled, held transactions are broadcast automatically.

### POST /keys/provision

```json
{
  "btcAddress": "bc1q...",
  "signature": "H9L5yLFj...",
  "message": "Bitcoin will be the currency of AIs"
}
```

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "apiKey": "x402_sk_test_a1b2c3d4...",
  "metadata": {
    "tier": "free",
    "expiresAt": "2026-03-22T12:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

## Error Codes

| Code | HTTP | Endpoint | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `SENDER_NONCE_GAP` | 400 | `/sponsor` | Sender nonce would create a gap in the sequence. Response includes `missingNonces[]` — submit transactions for those nonces first. |
| `TRANSACTION_HELD` | 202 | `/relay` | Sender nonce is out of order; transaction queued and will broadcast automatically when gap is filled. Response includes `queue` object with position and expiry. |
| `MALFORMED_PAYLOAD` | 400 | `/relay`, `/sponsor` | Request body failed schema validation. After 3 bad payloads from the same IP, subsequent requests return 429 until the window resets. |
| `QUEUE_NOT_FOUND` | 404 | `DELETE /queue/:senderAddress/:walletIndex/:sponsorNonce` | No held transaction matching the given coordinates. |
| `QUEUE_ACCESS_DENIED` | 403 | `DELETE /queue/:senderAddress/:walletIndex/:sponsorNonce` | Cancellation rejected — caller is not the original sender. |

- `sbtc` — sBTC transfers with sponsorship

## Common Workflows

### Gasless STX Transfer

1. Build sponsored transaction with `@stacks/transactions` (`sponsored: true`, `fee: 0n`)
2. Serialize to hex
3. POST to `/relay` with expected recipient and minimum amount
4. Wait for `settlement.status === "confirmed"`
